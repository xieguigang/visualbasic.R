#' @description List images
#' @details The default docker images will show all top level images,
#' their repository and tags, and their size.
#' Docker images have intermediate layers that increase reusability,
#' decrease disk usage, and speed up docker build by allowing each
#' step to be cached. These intermediate layers are not shown by
#' default.
#' The SIZE is the cumulative space taken up by the image and all its
#' parent images. This is also the disk space used by the contents of
#' the Tar file created when you docker save an image.
#' An image will be listed more than once if it has multiple repository
#' names or tags. This single image (identifiable by its matching IMAGE
#' ID) uses up the SIZE listed only once.
#'
#' @param all Show all images (default hides intermediate images)
#' @param digests Show digests
#' @param no_trunc Donâ€™t truncate output
#'
