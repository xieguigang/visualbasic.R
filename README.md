# visualbasic.R

Classical visualbasic language function implementations in R language.

NOTE: There is a bug in **roxygen2** package for build R package, when you build R package with **roxygen2** package, **roxygen2** will overrides the ``NAMESPACE`` file by replace with a line of code comment:

```R
# Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand
```

This will cause the R package can not export function, and cause the problem in R, like:

```
Error: object 'xxx' not found
```

So, when build the ``*.rd`` document, please use script file [./build.bat](./build.bat) for build the R package.
